# Chat checkpoint — 2025-08-24

This file is an automated checkpoint of the Copilot session state so work can continue from `egk@eliedesk` by pulling the repo.

Summary
- Purpose: prepare per-app Ceph RGW user & bucket for Immich and make it easy to resume the conversation and actions from `egk@eliedesk`.
- Files added in this checkpoint:
  - `scripts/create_rgw_user_and_bucket_admin.sh` — admin-side helper to create a least-privilege RGW user and bucket; writes `immich_rgw.env` and a policy template.
  - `docs/chat_checkpoint.md` — this file (checkpoint).

Next steps to continue on `egk@eliedesk`
1. On `egk@eliedesk` run:
   ```bash
   git -C ~/homelab pull origin main
   sudo chmod +x ~/homelab/scripts/create_rgw_user_and_bucket_admin.sh
   sudo ~/homelab/scripts/create_rgw_user_and_bucket_admin.sh --uid immich --bucket immich-uploads --endpoint http://100.64.163.40:80
   ```
2. If `radosgw-admin` errors with missing keyring, run the script on the true Ceph admin host (where `/etc/ceph` and admin keyring exist).
3. After the script produces `immich_rgw.env`, paste the `canonical_id` or the `immich_rgw.env` content into the open Copilot chat (or start a new Copilot chat in the `homelab` repo) to get a populated `policy.json` and assistance applying credentials to Docker secrets.

Notes
- Do not commit any secrets. `immich_rgw.env` is created with mode 600 and should not be checked in.
- If you want me to automate applying the policy or creating Docker secrets remotely, paste the admin command output here or start a new chat from `egk@eliedesk` and reference this checkpoint.
