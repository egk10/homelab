# üöÄ Production-Ready Homelab Configuration

**Status:** ‚úÖ PRODUCTION READY  
**Date:** August 26, 2025  
**Testing:** All 3-tier tests passed successfully  

## üéØ System Overview

This homelab provides self-hosted services accessible from anywhere via Tailscale VPN, with data redundancy and reliability provided by a Ceph storage cluster.

### ‚úÖ Production-Validated Services
- **Nextcloud** - File storage and collaboration
- **Immich** - Photo and video management  
- **Vaultwarden** - Password manager
- **Home Assistant** - Smart home automation

### ‚úÖ Core Architecture
- **Clean S3 Data-Only Design**: Application files in local Docker volumes, user data exclusively in Ceph S3
- **Auto-Recovery System**: S3FS auto-mounts after server reboot
- **Safe Container Management**: Pre-flight verification prevents local storage fallback
- **Tailscale Integration**: Secure remote access via encrypted VPN tunnels

## üèóÔ∏è Production Architecture

### S3FS Auto-Mount Services
```bash
# Core S3FS services (all active and enabled)
systemctl status s3fs-nextcloud-data.service
systemctl status s3fs-immich.service  
systemctl status s3fs-vaultwarden.service
```

### Storage Layout
```
/mnt/s3fs/nextcloud-data/   -> nextcloud-data bucket (Ceph S3)
/mnt/s3fs/immich/           -> immich-uploads bucket (Ceph S3)  
/mnt/s3/vaultwarden/        -> vaultwarden-backups bucket (Ceph S3)
```

### Container Management
```bash
# Safe startup with S3FS verification
./safe-compose.sh up -d

# Standard operations  
./safe-compose.sh down
./safe-compose.sh restart
./safe-compose.sh ps
```

## üîß Production Operations

### Daily Operations
```bash
# Check system status
./safe-compose.sh ps
systemctl status s3fs-*.service

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f [service]

# Backup verification
ls -la /mnt/s3/vaultwarden/backups/
```

### Post-Reboot Procedure
System auto-recovers, but for verification:
```bash
./test3_post_reboot.sh
```

### Service Access
- **Local Access**: http://localhost:[port]
- **Remote Access**: https://[service].your-tailscale-domain.ts.net
- **Ports**: Nextcloud(8081), Immich(2283), Vaultwarden(8083), HomeAssistant(8123)

## üìã Testing Validation

### ‚úÖ Test 1: Container Restart + Domain Access
- All services restart cleanly
- Tailscale domains respond with 200 OK
- No service interruption

### ‚úÖ Test 2: File Upload Verification  
- Files uploaded via web interface
- Verified storage in Ceph S3 buckets
- No local storage fallback

### ‚úÖ Test 3: Server Reboot Recovery
- Complete auto-recovery after reboot
- S3FS services auto-start
- All services accessible immediately
- Data persistence validated

## üõ°Ô∏è Production Safeguards

### Automatic Recovery
- **S3FS Auto-Mount**: Services start automatically after reboot
- **Safe Container Startup**: `safe-compose.sh` verifies mounts before starting containers
- **Mount Verification**: Pre-flight checks prevent local storage fallback

### Data Protection
- **Clean S3 Architecture**: User data only in Ceph, never local storage
- **Automated Backups**: Vaultwarden and Home Assistant daily backups to Ceph
- **Storage Redundancy**: Ceph cluster provides data redundancy

### Monitoring
- **Health Verification**: `verify_s3fs_mounts.sh` for operational checks
- **Storage Verification**: `verify_ceph_storage.sh` for data location validation

## üìä System Performance

### Storage Utilization
- **Nextcloud**: 163+ files, 389MB+ in S3
- **Immich**: Photos and videos in S3
- **Backups**: Automated daily backups
- **Local**: Only application files, no user data

### Network Performance
- **Local Access**: Sub-10ms response times
- **Tailscale Access**: Depends on internet connection
- **All Services**: Responsive and stable

## üîÑ Backup Strategy

### Automated Backups
```bash
# Vaultwarden - Daily at 2 AM
/home/egk/homelab/scripts/backup_vaultwarden.sh

# Home Assistant - Daily at 3 AM  
/home/egk/homelab/scripts/backup_homeassistant.sh
```

### Backup Locations
- **Vaultwarden**: `/mnt/s3/vaultwarden/backups/` (Ceph S3)
- **Home Assistant**: `/mnt/s3/homeassistant/backups/` (Ceph S3)
- **Retention**: 7 days automatic cleanup

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Services not starting**: Check S3FS mounts with `./scripts/verify_s3fs_mounts.sh`
2. **Files not accessible**: Verify Ceph connectivity with `./verify_ceph_storage.sh`
3. **Tailscale access**: Check tsdproxy container status

### Emergency Procedures
```bash
# Restart all S3FS services
sudo systemctl restart s3fs-*.service

# Restart all containers safely
./safe-compose.sh down && ./safe-compose.sh up -d

# Check mount points
findmnt | grep s3fs
```

## üìù Configuration Files

### Core Files
- `docker-compose.yml` - Main service orchestration
